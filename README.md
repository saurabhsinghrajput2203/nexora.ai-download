If the releases link does not load

- Check the Releases section of the repo if the link fails.

First run and setup
- Launch Nexora.
- Grant microphone and storage permissions if you plan to use voice or attachments.
- Go to Settings â†’ Integrations.
- Enter your Groq API key if you use Groq as a backend.
- Choose a default model and response length.

Example Groq integration flow
- In Settings, add your Groq API key.
- The app performs secure token retrieval from the Android Keystore.
- When you send a prompt, the app calls the Groq endpoint with the selected model, prompt, and parameters.
- Responses stream back to the UI and save in the local conversation store.

Common commands and tips
- Open a saved conversation: Menu â†’ Conversations.
- Export chat: Conversation â†’ Export â†’ JSON or TXT.
- Clear local cache: Settings â†’ Storage â†’ Clear cache.
- Toggle streaming mode for live output: Settings â†’ Streaming â†’ On/Off.

Developer notes
- The app uses a local SQLite store for conversation history.
- Network calls use an HTTP client with connection pooling and retries.
- The app supports Android API level 24 and up.
- You can fork the code, build an APK, and create your own releases.

API examples (conceptual)
- Send a chat completion:
  - POST /v1/complete
  - Body: { model, prompt, max_tokens, temperature }
- Receive streaming tokens via SSE or chunked transfer.
- The mobile client adapts to chunked or full responses.

Permissions and privacy
- Microphone: for voice input.
- Storage: for attachments and exported chats.
- Network: to call LLM backends.
- The app stores API keys encrypted in the Android Keystore.
- Conversation data stays local unless you export or sync.

Troubleshooting
- Install blocked: enable install from unknown sources or use Play Store flow if available.
- Parse error on install: confirm the APK downloaded completely. Re-download from the Releases page.
- App crashes on launch: force stop and clear app data. Reopen. If it persists, capture a log (adb logcat) and open an issue.
- API key errors: verify the key in Settings and check quota/permissions on the provider dashboard.

Security tips
- Use per-app API keys for better control.
- Revoke compromised keys from the provider console.
- Keep the device OS updated.
- Use device lock and encryption for sensitive data.
